# Security Summary

## CodeQL Analysis Results

### Date: October 26, 2025

---

## Analysis Complete ✅

### Alerts Found: 1

#### Alert Details:
- **Alert ID**: `js/incomplete-url-substring-sanitization`
- **Location**: `scripts/validate-canonical-consistency.mjs:133`
- **Severity**: Low (informational)
- **Status**: ✅ False Positive

#### Analysis:
The alert is triggered on line 133:
```javascript
if (!line.includes(CORRECT_CANONICAL_BASE)) {
```

**Why this is a false positive:**
1. **Context**: This is a validation script that checks static configuration files
2. **No User Input**: The script reads from `robots.txt` file, not from user input
3. **No Security Decision**: The check is purely for validation/reporting purposes
4. **No URL Parsing**: We're not sanitizing or parsing URLs for security purposes
5. **Static Content**: The script validates that sitemap URLs in robots.txt match the expected canonical domain

**Risk Assessment**: None - This is a validation tool, not a runtime security control.
