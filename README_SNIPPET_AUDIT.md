## üìû Questions?

### Common Questions Answered:

A: No! Start with Phase 1 (critical fixes) for immediate impact. Phases 2 and 3 can be done gradually.

A: No. You're only improving metadata, not changing page content or structure. Rankings should remain stable or improve.

**Q: How long until I see results?**  
A: Google typically recrawls within 7 days. CTR improvements should be visible in Search Console within 2-4 weeks.

**Q: Should I change my location pages?**  
A: No! They're already excellent. Only minor optimizations suggested (optional).

**Q: What about portal pages behind authentication?**  
A: Low priority. They don't need SEO optimization since users are already logged in.
