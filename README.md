⸻ 🔄 MIGRATION FROM CURRENT SITE

Why Not Fix Current Site? The current Vite SPA architecture fundamentally conflicts with SEO requirements. After 8 months of band-aid fixes (Edge Functions, static sitemaps, routing conflicts), it's clear that building on the right foundation (Next.js) is more efficient than continuing to patch architectural mismatches.

Parallel Development Approach

Current site stays live at downscale.com.au
Build new platform at staging subdomain
Test thoroughly with real patients
Switch DNS when ready (5-minute switchover)
Keep old site as backup for 30 days ⸻ 📈 FUTURE ROADMAP
