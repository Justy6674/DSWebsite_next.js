# Spec-Kit Integration Status

## Installation Complete âœ…

The GitHub Spec-Kit has been successfully installed and configured for the DS.H Healthcare Platform project.

### Files Created

#### Core Configuration
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - GitHub Copilot AI assistant context and guidelines
- `@copilot_portals_setup.md` - Copilot portals configuration and development workflow
- `memory/constitution.md` - Project principles and governance rules
- `memory/constitution_update_checklist.md` - Constitution validation and update tracking

#### Templates
- `templates/agent-file-template.md` - Agent context file template
- `templates/plan-template.md` - Technical implementation plan template  
- `templates/spec-template.md` - Feature specification template
- `templates/tasks-template.md` - Implementation task breakdown template
- `templates/commands/` - Slash command definitions for AI agents

#### Scripts
- `.specify/scripts/` - Bash and PowerShell scripts for spec-driven development automation

### Available Slash Commands

The following slash commands are now available for GitHub Copilot and other AI agents:

- `/constitution` - Create or update project governing principles
- `/specify` - Define feature requirements and user stories  
- `/plan` - Create technical implementation plans
- `/tasks` - Generate actionable task lists
- `/implement` - Execute implementation according to plan

### Usage Examples

#### Starting a New Feature
```bash
/specify Build a patient appointment booking system that integrates with Medicare billing and supports Australian healthcare provider workflows
```

#### Creating Implementation Plan
```bash
/plan Use React with TypeScript, implement real-time booking with Supabase, ensure healthcare compliance and accessibility standards
```

#### Generating Tasks
```bash
/tasks
```

#### Executing Implementation
```bash
/implement
```

### Project Context

The spec-kit is configured specifically for the DS.H healthcare platform with:

- **Healthcare Focus**: Patient safety, compliance, and Australian medical regulations
- **Technical Stack**: React/TypeScript, Vite, Supabase, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS
- **SEO Optimization**: Australian healthcare market targeting
- **Performance Standards**: Medical-grade reliability (99.9% uptime, <200ms response)
- **Compliance**: HIPAA, Australian healthcare regulations, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility

### Next Steps

1. **Use Constitution**: Reference `memory/constitution.md` for all development decisions
2. **Create Specifications**: Use `/specify` command to define new features
3. **Plan Implementation**: Use `/plan` command for technical planning
4. **Execute Development**: Follow spec-driven methodology for consistent results

### Integration Benefits

- **Consistency**: Standardized development workflow across all features
- **Quality**: Built-in compliance and healthcare considerations
- **Efficiency**: AI-assisted development with healthcare domain expertise
- **Documentation**: Automatic generation of specifications and plans
- **Compliance**: Healthcare regulations built into the development process

The platform is now ready for spec-driven development with GitHub Copilot integration!
