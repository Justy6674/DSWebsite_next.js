## Implementation Details

### Pages Updated
1. **Homepage** (`/`): Added Organization and WebSite schemas
2. **Blog Posts** (`/blog/[slug]`): Dynamic metadata with full SEO attributes
3. **26 Location Pages**: Complete SEO overhaul with unique metadata
4. **Key Service Pages**: Alt text added to all images

### Metadata Structure (Example)
Every page now includes:
- Title (unique, descriptive)
- Description (compelling, accurate)
- Keywords (relevant to content)
- Open Graph tags (title, description, image, URL)
- Twitter Card tags
- Canonical URL
- Robots directives (index, follow, googleBot settings)

### Sitemap Architecture
```
sitemap-index.xml (master index)
├── sitemap.xml (71 main pages)
├── sitemap-blog.xml (blog posts from Supabase)
├── sitemap-locations.xml (26 location pages)
└── sitemap-images.xml (image references)
```

### Build Output
```
✓ 71 static pages generated
○ (Static) prerendered as static content
ƒ (Dynamic) server-rendered on demand for blog/[slug]
```

## Technical Notes

### Google Font Issue
- Temporarily disabled Google Font import in `layout.tsx`
- Using system fonts (`font-sans`) instead
- This allows builds to succeed in environments without external network access
- Can be re-enabled in production environment with internet access

### Blog Crawlability
- Blog posts are crawlable even though they use dynamic routes
- Metadata is generated server-side from Supabase
- Sitemap includes all published blog post URLs
- RSS feed provides additional discovery mechanism
